## ETL challenge

### 1. Structuring the Data Lakehouse/Data Lake Storage

For structuring the data lakehouse or data lake storage, I'd lean towards organizing it in a way that balances analytical efficiency with ease of access. The structure I'd use involves several layers, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **Raw Layer:** This is where I'd store data exactly as it arrives, in its native format. It's crucial for ensuring that you have an unaltered record of the original data. I'd organize this layer into folders named by the data source and ingestion date, such as `raw/purchases/2023-07-22/`.
- **Processed Layer:** After the raw data is validated and cleaned, it moves to the processed layer. This layer would contain data that's been transformed but is still in a granular, detailed form. I'd structure it similarly to the raw layer but with an additional categorization based on the transformation logic or version, for example, `processed/purchases/v1/2023-07-22/`.
- **Aggregated Layer:** This is for data that's been further summarized or aggregated, ready for analysis. It might be organized by analytical themes, like `aggregated/sales_summary/2023/07/`.
- **Curated Layer:** The cream of the crop, data in this layer is fully processed, conformed to business rules, and ready for high-level analytics and reporting. It would be structured by business domain, such as `curated/finance/purchases_summary/`.

For file naming conventions, I'd use a combination of the source identifier, date of ingestion, and a version number if applicable, like `purchases_2023-07-22_v1.parquet`.

### 2. Ingesting and Saving Source Data

To ingest and save the source data into the data lake storage, I'd first set up automated data ingestion pipelines. Tools like Apache NiFi or AWS Glue can be really handy here, as they can handle scheduled data pulls from various sources. The key steps I'd follow are:

- **Schedule Regular Ingestion:** Automate the data ingestion process to run at a specific time, likely soon after the source system updates daily.
- **Validation and Metadata Tagging:** As data is ingested, perform basic validation checks (like schema validation) and tag each file with metadata, including the ingestion date and source. This helps with traceability and management.
- **Save to Raw Layer:** Store the ingested files in the raw layer of the data lake without any transformation, ensuring data is captured in its original state.

### 3. Processing and Transforming Source Data

Processing and transforming the source data involves several key steps:

- **Schema Validation:** I'd start by validating the schema of the ingested data against a predefined schema to ensure consistency.
- **Cleaning and Standardization:** Next, clean the data to remove duplicates, fill missing values based on predefined rules, and standardize formats (like date formats) to ensure consistency across the dataset.
- **Transformation:** For the task at hand, transforming data would involve capturing changes over time. This could mean applying logic to differentiate new records, updated records, and unchanged records since the last ingestion.
- **Store Transformed Data:** Save the transformed data in the processed layer, maintaining a clear versioning system to track iterations of the data over time.

### 4. Building and Saving the Data Model

For building and saving the data model, I'd focus on designing models that support the analytical needs of the business while ensuring data integrity and history are preserved:

- **Dimensional Modeling:** Utilize a star or snowflake schema for analytical models, where transactions form the fact table and attributes (like product, user, etc.) form dimension tables. This structure supports a wide range of queries efficiently.
- **Version Control:** Implement a system to version the data models, allowing for evolution over time without losing the ability to query historical states.
- **Storage Format and Partitioning:** I'd store the data models in a columnar storage format (like Parquet) for efficient querying and partition the data in a way that supports common queries, such as by date or product.

### 5. Generating a History of the Data

Generating and maintaining a history of the data is crucial for tracking changes over time and supporting temporal queries:

- **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Implement CDC mechanisms to capture updates to records in the source system. This can be done by comparing snapshots of the data or using database logs to identify changes.
- **Temporal Tables:** For key datasets, like purchases, use temporal tables in the data lakehouse to keep a history of changes. This involves storing not just the current state of each record but also historical states, with timestamps indicating the validity period of each state.
- **Access Patterns:** Ensure that the data model and storage structure support efficient querying of both the current state and historical states of data. This might
